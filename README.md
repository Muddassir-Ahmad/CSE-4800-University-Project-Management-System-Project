This is my final year project (CSE-4800)
This repository hosts the codebase for a comprehensive Project Management System tailored for university settings. Developed using HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, JavaScript, and PHP, this system offers a robust platform for organizing, tracking, and managing various academic projects within a university environment. Leveraging Bootstrap for a responsive design, the interface ensures seamless accessibility across devices. JavaScript functionalities enrich user interactions, while PHP powers dynamic features such as project creation, task allocation, progress tracking, and collaborative tools. Dive into the code to explore how this system streamlines project workflows and enhances project management within an academic setting.
